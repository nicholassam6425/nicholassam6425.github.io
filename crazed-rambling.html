<b>mmorpg manifesto</b><br>
recently, in mmos, i've seen games that have pretty good breadth. examples that i like are lavaflame2's idleon, and a higher budget example would be new world.
these examples have good breadth because they have options for players to do something other than combat. 
in history, classic rpgs were mainly hyperfocused on combat, with maybe a splash of romance gameplay on charming some low poly women.
personally, i haven't really played too many classic rpgs, but from videos and other media, that's mostly what it is. and that's fine. 
they had limitations back in the day that actually required this lower breadth. but such limitations also grew into a habit, which is affecting current day games.
we have the ability now to have greater breadth. idleon is an indie game, developed (as far as i know) by one single dude, lavaflame2. it has a pretty good breadth of
activities that the player could partake in, such as the classics, mining, woodcutting, crafting, but also some more mundane, such as construction or bug catching.
of course, even though it does have pretty good breadth, it doesn't have a lot of depth, probably because it IS one guy developing it. shout out lavaflame2 ur a beast. 
the extent you can go in each activity is pretty much just park one of you characters on the node and either play a little minigame, which you can do a couple times a 
day, or just afk there while you swap to one of your other characters. it's more of a management game in that sense, where you just tell your workers, or in this case, 
your characters to do something for a while, then check back in later to start upgrading. on the other hand, new world is a triple A mmo, developed by amazon game studios,
a game studio supported by a top 10, if not top 3 company in the world. its breadth is less than idleon, and its depth in anything other than combat is just about the same
as idleon. you walk around, chop trees, or mine rocks, upgrade your (pick)axe then mine more or better trees or rocks. <br>
wait. what? that's weird. how did a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?leadSource=reddit_wall">studio with
$500m usd per year</a> manage to do just about as much as a single, indie developer? obviously, not all of it goes into specifically breadth, or even gameplay. a huge portion 
probably went to marketting, a sizable chunk to art, creating the engine it runs on, etc etc. let's say, pretty conservatively, that $500k went to designing the absolute, raw
basics that the mmo is focused on. a 3 faction pvp mmo, based on siege warfare, supported by lifeskills. obviously, the siege warfare pvp is going to be the main focus of this
design, so let's say $100k went to designing the lifeskills. how did we end up with something that can literally be automated by a macro? need i remind you, the basis of your
economy is supposed to be lifeskills. on launch, i made a sizable chunk of fortune by just mining iron ore. but once people realized lifeskill gathering nodes spawn in the
exact same spot, on a set interval, we just had people afk sitting there clicking one single button, probably with a macro. nice! we spent one guy's salary on... a single
button click, every minute! nice work!
<br><br>
why give a fuck?<br>
in terms that some industry corpo can understand, breadth increases player retention. the average person can't just sit there doing raids for days or months on end, they 
want something to clear the palate in between raids. a good ol' day at the lake, fishing with the gang, or a mindless clicking of buttons in the mines while watching netflix.
if they're some gigasweat who doesn't want to do this, they simply dont need to. but to spoil the next topic a little, they should still be at least mildly reliant on
lifeskills. ESPECIALLY in a big 'country vs country' mmo, like elyon (i think?) or archeage. being reliant on your own 'team's' lifeskillers creates competition in not
only the pvp aspect, but also lifeskilling. and as we know, competition also increases player retention. 
<br><br>
i get kinda pissed here so here's your warning. <br>
words that a christian mother would gasp at, but a 18 year old would completely ignore <br>
<br>
breadth already exists, why are we even talking about this?<br>
even in my great examples, the breadth fucking sucks. the MOST IMPORTANT part of breadth is how you tie it back to the main deal, combat. it's how you get the sweats to even 
do the side activities. for example, new world ties their mining, woodcutting and herbalism (im gonna call these lifeskills now) to weapons and armor. 
this drives the economy of the game by making the lifeskillers the primary producers, and secondary manufacturers. in case you don't know, you can basically just tie a 
lifeskill to a certain point in economy, producers (the people who 'generate' something), manufacturers (the people who refine the producer's materials), and the consumers
(the people who use these products). for example, a gatherer who gathers medicinal herbs, an alchemist who creates more effective potions from such herbs, and the combatants
that use such potions. now, this is already down pat. a majority of games with breadth have this already. new world's example above, maplestory has something similar, archeage
has the added point in economy of transit, lost ark's lifeskills has a kinda smaller reward than these, and so on. it's fucking DISAPPOINTING. why the fuck are we punishing
players for spending their time being the PRIMARY DRIVING FORCE OF THE ECONOMY? new world's life skills are infamously fucking mindnumbing, maplestory somehow has it worse
than new world, archeage is okay but im biased, lost ark literally wastes my fucking time if im not a bot. i fished for hours in lost ark, only for bots to come in and fucking
plummet the fish economy to fucking atoms.<br>
in a majority of mmos i play, i like focusing on lifeskills. it lets me connect to the community through trading, which is much less time consuming than staying on top of 
raids, pvp, etc etc. in almost every single one, i have looked at my progress, and every single time, i have acknowledged that i am stunting my combat growth. for what fucking
reason? combat, while depicted above as the consumer, still produces materials from creatures you hunt. you can pvp, you can raid, you can hunt. what is the fucking point
of lifeskills? to jerk off combatants? i lifeskill to be self-sufficient, not to help some basement dweller continue to basement dwell. in practice, combatants should be 
reliant on lifeskillers. why the fuck are mobs dropping pots? why the fuck are they dropping whole, undamaged, pristine weapons that are good to be used on the spot? a fucking
ogre isnt going to drop some perfectly maintained battleaxe, it's going to be scratched, bent, dirty and unusable. 
<br><br>
manual vs automation<br>
one major issue i can think of for buffing lifeskills is bots. was a huge problem from day 1 for new world, huge problem in lost ark, etc etc. a couple ideas could be
implemented to reduce reward for botting. firstly, the one that sits in the back of my mind constantly, is just rewarding lifeskills with combat ability. that means to
fully reap the rewards of lifeskilling, you must partake in some form of combat. this may not be lifeskiller's cup of tea, but its just an idea. imagine how sick it would be
for you to tailor to high levels, then you get to basically wield a needle like a rapier or something? idk there's probably better ideas, just ask chatgpt or something
another idea is reduced effectiveness when repeating the same activity. actually learning something in real life doesn't involve you just sitting there doing the same thing.
you need to experience new things to properly learn and master a field. you're not going to become a phd chemist by just sitting there and mixing the exact same two
solutions all day, you're going to become a phd chemist by exploring what was previously unknown. now this brings up another issue of breadth. content, currently, cannot keep
up with the pace that players consume. maybe if you somehow forcefully limit information exchange, but you never really can do that. there may be a possibility in the future,
and even in the near future, with ai like chatgpt coming up, it makes it easier to expand content, and even create unique experiences per player. 
<br><br>
what to learn from this crazed rambling<br>
here's the hopefully educational part. if you're making an rpg game, doesn't have to be an mmo, think about your depth versus your breadth. breadth is the number of different
styles of content your players have, while depth is how long each type of content goes. an absolutely perfect game has an 'equal' amount of breadth and depth. of course, they're
non-measurable, but you get the idea. a good amount of games now have good depth, a couple pretty deep, non-mmo games i can think of are realm grinder and tap titans 2. this 
likely may be because their progression time is way slower because of their idle/incremental genre, but it still takes a while to explore all the different ways to make money
or kill titans optimally. now, their main problem is that that is literally all you can do in those games. buy passive income generators or click mobs. a little more on the
depth-breadth balance i can think of is stardew valley. you can farm, mine, romance, fish, and fight. all four activities also go for pretty long times to fully complete, and
the player is encouraged to partake in these by the community center rewards. <br>
basically, what im saying is that stardew valley has really good depth-breadth balance. i just really fucking want an mmorpg to have this level of balance. the closest i have
personally played is archeage, and that game is the worst pay to win garbage ever, and archeage unchained was managed by the worst motherfuckers on this planet (no flame, i
still spent like, 4 months straight playing it). 
<br><br>
as im writing this, i found out that archeage is making some fucking nft snake oil block chain fucking dogshit mmo? i fucking hate this shit? the fucking point of block chain
or nfts is to fucking decentralize everything. what is the fucking point of block chains in mmos, when the fucking mmo is managed by a company? they're gonna be doing all 
the fucking bookkeeping anyway, so why the fuck are you wasting time and energy to fucking essentially mine bitcoin without any actual benefit? archeage continues to show how
genuinely retarded they are at managing what is honestly a gem of a game. a fucking shame.

sup im trying albion. currently doing tutorial, but server went down for maintenance. the first thing they teach is lifeskills, and it lookks like there's lifeskilling skill
tree? hopefully it's fun for me. started because itsmasayoshi/masayoshi/john from otv is playing and it looked interesting. gonna join his guild, they probably don't have
a lot of dedicated lifeskillers. gonna try to learn this either until i get bored or until japan (2 months from now.)
<br><br>

did new world just copy paste this game? everything works the exact same. local marketplaces, faction pvp for land, gear = level, etc etc. the only real difference is 3d vs iso2d.
it feels like new world is just a modern remake of albion, which isnt even that old
<br><br>
may 1st 2023<br>
sup i remembered another point i had on new world. the world feels so dead. devoid of life. even in the most populated areas, settlements, the only moving objects are players.
we have this whole setting of survivors on some crazy magical island, you're telling me all of them just sit in settlements, talking over plans for all of eternity? maybe the 
point is that the players are the survivors who aren't standing in one place all day, but that's not a good excuse. players usually need a call to action, and by limiting
yourself to only the type of npcs that stand around, you lose out on a lot of gameplay elements that could be implemented. the point is, the game is
missing is events. points in history that, if you were living in that setting, that you would write down in your diary or journal. not even huge events, just simple, small ones.
like, imagine how fun an escort event would be. a faction npc caravan announced a day in advance where that faction can escort it to its destination for a reward, and enemy
factions can ambush it for rewards. or i dunno, like some crazy world boss that drops a couple crates that you have to lug back to a settlement (stealing that idea from
archeage). like, you log in, and there's no surprise. you already know what's gonna happen today, tomorrow, and the day after. at most you're surprised that some other faction
declared war on your territory. that's nothing big. logging in and seeing 'oh shit an event is happening in 2 hours' leads to 'is anyone else doing it?' leads to 'fuck it
lets go.'
