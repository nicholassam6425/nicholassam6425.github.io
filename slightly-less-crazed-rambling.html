sup, the only way here is from mmo manifesto, i think. if you read that, thanks for listening to my shitty fucking rambling. here's some more.<br>
have you ever thought about why some games are so successful? league of legends is a game that pops in my mind for a game that had way too much success, for what it was.
don't get me wrong, i love league. i've played it for, like, 12 years now or something, i know every ability on every champion, i used to play at least 20 games a week,
though now its dropped to maybe a game a week. still love the game, just despise playing it with random teammates. now, to get onto the actual topic, the social aspect of
games. throughout my time playing league, i realized that, maybe 20-30% of my games on league were initiated by one of my friends inviting me to a game, without any prior
plan or anything. like, i leave open the league client, watch some youtube videos or streams, then i hear the invite sound, see its from a friend, accept it, then hop in the
discord call (im always on do not disturb, so i don't get discord notifications, and from checking servers im in, a lot of people are also on do not disturb). this is simply 
brilliant. a method of gaining players, which im almost certain riot did by accident. their client sucks ass, but because it sucks ass, it takes up barely any memory, cpu or
gpu processing power. another thing to note is that logging in isn't really that hard, but to update the game in your off-hours, keeping client open is the only way. now,
this accidental combination of shit just ends up making a positive effect, that encourages people to play the game more. i'm not attributing all of riot or league's success
to having a shitty client, but i'm saying it definitely plays a notable factor. a parallel can be drawn here to steam, but i rarely get unprovoked invites through steam.
steam is essentially a lightweight launcher, that players can invoke other friends to play games with.<br><br>
why care?<br>
by harnessing your playerbase, you can get more people playing your game. inherently, this kind of strategy doesn't pull in new players. BUT, with a platform like steam,
its possible. the only thing holding it back is culture/tradition. the only reason people on steam aren't doing this kind of thing is because no one does it, so doing it is 
weird. if steam somehow manages to break this stigma, steam would definitely pull a lot more games to it. there's also a barrier though, for games you have to purchase. inviting 
someone to a game that costs money if they don't have it is difficult. you're basically asking them if they want to spend money. epic mildly breaks through this barrier with 
their exorbitant amount of game giveaways. it invites players to play with their friends the week of the giveaway, because they all got it for free at about the same time. 
the problem is that it's free, so they make no money.
