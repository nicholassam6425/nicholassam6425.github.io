1. possible to fuck with the game possibly by setting charnames to element ids
2. figure out how stats interact with party. i.e add up or take max or whatever?
    - stat dependent. will figure out later.
3. should idle damage crit? maybe reduced crit damage on idle?
4. unique monsters, like how trimps or tap titans does it
    - monsters that skip stages, increase gold drop, increase item drop, recover mana, etc

# possible issues
- characters in the party are saved as separate entities than their charlist self. could cause an issue. should be a relatively easy fix
# currently working on:
xp distribution (attack function)
levelling system (character class)
